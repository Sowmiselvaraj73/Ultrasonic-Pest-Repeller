Ultrasonic Pest Repeller Overview

This project demonstrates an ultrasonic pest repeller that emits high-frequency sound waves to drive away pests like rodents and insects. The system uses a 555 timer-based oscillator, amplifier, and ultrasonic transducer to generate and transmit sound above 20 kHz, a range inaudible to humans but disturbing to pests.

Components (General)

555 Timer IC (Oscillator)

Ultrasonic Transducer

Resistors and Capacitors (for frequency generation)

Transistor (for signal amplification)

Power Supply (Battery or Adapter)

Breadboard or PCB

Connecting Wires

Working Principle

The 555 Timer IC generates a square wave signal at ultrasonic frequency (>20 kHz).

The signal is amplified using a transistor circuit (optional, for higher output).

The Ultrasonic Transducer converts the electrical signal into high-frequency sound waves.

Pests detect these waves and move away from the source area.
